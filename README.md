# FateGen
FateGen is a MySQL/PHP/JavaScript application for managing a Fate Core campaign.

The main "fate.php" file displays the character sheets of all player characters, their comparative ratings in all skills, and their initiative order in both physical and social conflicts.

"fateaspects.php" sorts all characters and places into a random order and selects one random aspect from each. This is useful for imagining new connections when designing scenarios.

"fategen.php" provides a responsive form for character creation and modification, including applying milestones to player characters.

"fatesheets.php" displays all player character sheets, and adds the option of selecting NPC sheets to show as well.

"fateinit.php" does similar for initiative, and also provides tables which incorporate fate points and stress tracks, for updating during a conflict (such as via Google Docs).
